## Components for the webapp
1. header --> title + p
2. joke --> displays joke text
3. footer --> h3 & h4

## How I plan to execute this project
1. structure the entire project
2. create all components
3. work on each component in this order, header --> joke --> footer
4. style it

## What have i learnt?
1. conditional rendering
    - no special syntax, works the same way as regular js
2. rendering lists
    - inside a component, use map to transform an array of something into an array of li items
    - and for each item in a list, it needs to have a key attribute
    - useState
3. learnt how to work with useState
4. how to handle events via buttons

## My thought processes as I work on this project
1. decide on the relevant components and structure it
2. i think i need to get a really good grasp on "props", so i'll use this [link](https://legacy.reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
3. now, i gotta work on understanding responding to/handling events -- [this link helped](https://react.dev/learn)
4. found a public REST APIs on the Postman API network [this](https://www.postman.com/cs-demo/public-rest-apis/documentation/tfzpqfc/public-rest-apis?entity=request-8854915-86a5b520-e907-4eee-95fd-6dcdc24f8a83)
5. really focused on understanding these --> useState, useEffect, fetch
